Code and data for the paper entitled *Detecting Fake Review Buyers Using Network Structure: Direct Evidence from Amazon*.

Code is written with Python 3.9.12. Running **classification.py** and **clustering.py** will produce the supervised and unsupervised approach results, respectively, in the paper. 
- To run the **classification.py**, you only need the product-level data that contain the metadata, image, network, and text features, which are available in the "data" folder.
- To run the **clustering.py**, you need the product- and review-level data. Product level data is included in the "data" folder, however, you need to download review-level data from Dropbox.
